## 1. Web application structure

### 1.1 List of courses
#### Route: @app.route("/listcourses")  
#### Function: listcourses()   getCursor()
#### Template: courselist.html  
#### Data: motorkhana database course table, the course_id name and image
#### Relationship:
The route /listcourses is directly related to the listcourses() function. When this route is accessed by a user through their web browser, it triggers the execution of listcourses().

This function connects to motorkhana database course table, retrieves all entries from the 'course' table in the database:  the course_id name and image, and then sends this data to the template "courselist.html" for rendering.

The data is stored in courseList, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row from the 'course' table in the database. This courseList is passed to the "courselist.html" template as course_list.


### 1.2 Driverâ€™s run details
####  Route: @app.route("/driverdetails" methods=["GET", "POST"])
####  Function: driverdetails() getCursor()
####  Template: driverdetails.html
####  Data: motorkhana database - driver, run, course, car tables
#### Relationship:
The route /driverdetails is directly related to the driverdetails() function. When this route is accessed by a user through their web browser, it triggers the execution of driverdetails().

If it's a "GET" request and there's no driver name in the URL, the function fetches all driver names and displays an initial form with a dropdown menu, allowing the user to select a driver's name. The names are fetched using data (first name and surname) from the 'driver' table.

If it's a "POST" request or if a driver's name is specified, the function will either return the initial form with driver names (if the "return" button was pressed)  or the function will proceed to fetch detailed information about the selected driver. The information joins multiple tables (driver, run, course, car). It's sent to the "driverdetails.html" template for rendering. The data is stored in driver_details, which is a list of dictionaries.

### 1.3 List of drivers
#### Route: @app.route("/listdrivers")
#### Function: listdrivers() getCursor()
#### Template: listdrivers.html
#### Data: motorkhana database - driver and car tables
#### Relationship:

Inside the function listdrivers() , it retries data from the database. The data comes from the 'driver' and 'car' tables, including names, car models, and driving classes. After retrieval, the data is stored in a list of tuples named driver_details. This list is then passed to the listdrivers.html template via the drivers context variable.
The listdrivers.html template: It iterates over its contents to display each driver's details on the webpage.
Driver names in the table serve as links to selected driver's deatails (/driverdetails).

### 1.4 List of drivers
#### Route: @app.route("/overallresults")
#### Function: overallresults() fetch_overallresults() getCursor()
#### Template: overallresults.html
#### Data: motorkhana database - tables including 'driver', 'run', 'course', and 'car'
#### Relationship:
The overallresults() function, is triggered by accessing the /overallresults route.

By calling fetch_overallresults() executes a SQL query. It calculates overall result for each driver, etc.

The gathered data, representing various aspects like the fastest times and overall scores is organized into a list of tuples known as overallResults. This overallResults data is then send to the "overallresults.html" template. 

Moreover, the template has a direct link for visual performance analytics (See Top5 Driver's Graph)

###  1.5 Bar graph
#### Route: @app.route("/graph")
#### Function: showgraph() fetch_overallresults()
#### Template: top5graph.html
#### Data: motorkhana database - tables including 'driver', 'run', 'course', and 'car'
showgraph() calls fetch_overallresults() to get data from the database.

The function picks the top 5 results from the fetched data.

It prepares two lists: one for the drivers' names (bestDriverList) and one for their scores (resultsList).
These lists are sent to the top5graph.html template.

The template uses Plotly to create a graph showing the top performances.
The names list forms the Y-axis, and the scores list forms the X-axis of the graph.

### 1.6 Administrator Interface
### Route: @app.route("/admin_interface")
### Function: admin_interface()
### Template: admin_interface.html
### Data: No direct database interaction occurs in this function.

The function admin_interface() renders the 'admin_interface.html' template, providing no direct data interaction. The template outlines administrative tasks, each linked to different application routes using Flask's 'url_for' function.

### 1.7 Junior driver list
### Route: @app.route("/juniordriverlist")
### Function: juniordriverlist() getCursor()
### Template: juniordriverlist.html
### Data: Motorkhana database - 'driver' table

The juniordriverlist() function interacts with the 'driver' table to retrieve information about junior drivers. It executes a SQL query to fetch details like driver's name, date of birth, age, and caregiver information. 

After fetching and refining the data, a list of junior drivers is compiled, list is passed to the 'juniordriverlist.html' template.

The template constructs a table displaying the junior drivers' details, with a navigation link back to the Admin Interface. 


### 1.8 Driver search
### Route: @app.route("/searchname" methods=["GET", "POST"])
### Function: searchname() getCursor()
### Template: searchname.html
### Data: Motorkhana database - 'driver' table

The function searchname() can handle both GET and POST methods for form submission. When the form is submitted (POST request), it takes the keyword input for driver's name, and searches in the 'driver' table of the database for matches by first or last name.

These results are then sent to the 'searchname.html' template. The template includes a form that allows users to input a search keyword for driver's name. 

The template extends the basic structure from "admin_interface.html" and includes a link to navigate back to the main Admin Interface.

### 1.9 Edit runs
### Route: @app.route("/edit_runs")
### Function: edit_runs()
### Template: edit_runs.html
### Data: No direct database interaction occurs in this function.
The edit_runs() function renders the "edit_runs.html" template. This template is extends from "admin_interface.html".

Within the "edit_runs.html" template, there's a navigational section presented as a list with two links, allowing the user to choose between editing runs by driver or by course. These links, 'Choose a driver to edit runs' and 'Choose a course to edit runs', redirect to the respective routes edit_runs_driver and edit_runs_course.

###  1.9.1 Edit runs driver

###  1.10 Add driver
### Route:@app.route(/add_driver)
### Function: add_driver()
### Template: add_driver.html
